RESEARCH EXPERIENCE 

PhD-Chemistry 

Harvesting and separation of platinum isotopes for radiocisplatin generation. 

PI: Dr Katharina Domnanich| August 2023 – Present 
 
This work focuses on the solid isotope harvesting of Pt-197 and Pt-189 from the FRIB beamline, followed by the development of efficient isolation and purification strategies. The purified platinum radioisotopes are then explored for the synthesis of radiocisplatin. The use of radiolabeled cisplatin as a cancer theranostic has the potential to enhance anti-tumor efficacy by combining the chemotherapeutic action of cisplatin with the theranostic capabilities of the platinum isotopes. 
 
Harvesting and separation of calcium-47 isotope for scandium-47 production  

PI: Dr Katharina Domnanich| April-July 2025  
 
The work is a test for proof-of-principal for isotope harvester designed for platinum isotopes. The project is focused on the solid isotope harvesting of Ca-47 from the FRIB beamline using Ca-48 isotope. This is followed by the development of a suitable isolation methodology and utilization of the purified products for Ca-47/Sc-47 generator system.  

Production and separation of promethium-149 isotope for cancer therapeutics. 

PI: Dr Katharina Domnanich| August 2024 - Present 
 
The project explores the production and isolation of Pm-149, a promising radioisotope for cancer therapeutic. Separation methods using cation exchange chromatography has been explored. The main objective is to optimize the production and separation of high purity Pm-149 produced from enriched Nd-148 targets via neutron irradiation in a reactor.

INTERNSHIPS:  

University of Tennessee, Knoxville | July-Aug,2024 

At Dr. Chaple’s lab, I worked on the fabrication of ionic liquids and explored their potential application in separating platinum isotopes from irradiated iridium foils for medical use. Ionic liquids are custom-designed hybrid materials, created by combining ionic salts with solid resin supports, offering superior performance and adaptability for targeted separation processes. 

Oil and Gas Corporation, GOI | January, 2015  

This opportunity exposed me to the extraction mechanisms and Technologies used to extract Crude oil from underground. The Gadimoga plant which is operating since the 1980s closely gave me insights and was fortunate to learn under Experts with some real experience in the regime.
